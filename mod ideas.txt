Rather than having multiple mods that are all adding similar things, it makes sense to have single mods that have all the different things added into them.

My idea for mods would be something along the lines of this.

Animals: all the animals, monsters, tamable and not.
Armor: basically just 3d_armor, but changed to be more realistic
ground: different types of soils for the different biomes, stones, and sand.
Farming: This would mostly just be an API
Furniture: Things to beautify your house with.
Food: This would include raw and cooked foods, and the yields of plants
Hunger: hunger, thirst, and illnesses should all work together.
Machines: Most machines should go here, really anything that has a formspec.
Mobs: just the mob api.
metals: all the minerals that can be found in the ground
Plants: All plants, trees, shrubs, veggies, grasses, etc.
Spawn: all the nodes needed for the spawn location building, creative only, no craft recipes.(space ship nodes, autostores, signs with instructions.)
Storage: Chests, bottles, cups, buckets, etc.
Tools: All tools, weapons, etc.
